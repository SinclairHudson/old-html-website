# Personal Website (www.sinclairhudson.com)
This repository is for my own personal website, which I am designing from scratch. It will be used as a sort of portfolio for any projects I do or any adventures I embark on. Narcissistic? A little bit. But it's important to keep track of these things, for employment and social reasons. It's nice to be able to present something that displays the highlights of my journey down the rabbit hole of computer science.
